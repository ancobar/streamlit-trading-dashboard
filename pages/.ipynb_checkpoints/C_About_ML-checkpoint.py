We used various technical indicators and stock price features to train our Machine Learning model:
- **Price Changes**: 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day percentage changes
- **Moving Averages**: 7-day, 14-day, and 20-day moving averages
- **Volatility**: Standard deviation over 7 days
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: 14-day RSI indicator
- **Bollinger Bands**: 20-day upper and lower bands
- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**: 12-day and 26-day EMAs
- **MACD Indicator**: Difference between 12-day and 26-day EMAs

# Portfolio Simulation Explanation

st.write("""
To evaluate the trading strategy, we implemented a **Buy-Hold-Sell** simulation based on model predictions.

**Trading Strategy Assumptions:**
- Initial capital: **$10,000**, equally distributed among the six BigTech stocks.
- **Buy** if there is enough capital. The minimum capital available has to be 500 at all times.
- **Sell** if price **drops by more than 5%** (stop-loss) or **rises by more than 10%** (profit-taking).

**Simulation Execution:**
- Iterate through historical stock prices day by day.
- Use ML model predictions to determine whether to Buy, Hold, or Sell.
- Update **capital, stock holdings, and portfolio value** over time.
